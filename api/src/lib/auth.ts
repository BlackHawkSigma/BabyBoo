 * The session object sent in as the first argument to getCurrentUser() will
 * have a single key `id` containing the unique ID of the logged in user
 * (whatever field you set as `authFields.id` in your auth function config).
 * You'll need to update the call to `db` below if you use a different model
 * name or unique field name, for example:
 *
 *   return await db.profile.findUnique({ where: { email: session.id } })
 *                   ───┬───                       ──┬──
 *      model accessor ─┘      unique id field name ─┘
 *
 * !! BEWARE !! Anything returned from this function will be available to the
 * client--it becomes the content of `currentUser` on the web side (as well as
 * `context.currentUser` on the api side). You should carefully add additional
 * fields to the `select` object below once you've decided they are safe to be
 * seen if someone were to open the Web Inspector in their browser.
